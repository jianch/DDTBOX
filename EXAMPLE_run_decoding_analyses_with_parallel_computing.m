%% Things you need to know before use Parallel Computing in MATLAB

% check if you have Parallel Computing Toolbox installed

% if not, install Parallel Computing Toolbox







%% Housekeeping

% Clears the workspace and closes all figure windows
clear variables;
close all;




%% Select Subject Datasets and Discrimination Groups (dcgs)

% Set the subject datasets on which to perform MVPA
sbj_todo = [1:5];

% Enter the discrimination groups (dcgs) for decoding analyses. 
% Each discrimination group should be in a separate cell entry.
% Decoding analyses will be run for all dcgs listed here.
% e.g. dcgs_for_analyses{1} = [1];
% e.g. dcgs_for_analyses{2} = [3];
% Two discrimination groups can be entered when performing cross-condition decoding.
% (SVM trained using the first entry/dcg, tested on the second entry/dcg)
% e.g. dcgs_for_analyses{1} = [1, 2];

dcgs_for_analyses{1} = [1];
% dcgs_for_analyses{2} = [2];

% Perform cross-condition decoding? 
% 0 = No / 1 = Yes

cross = 0;




%% Filepaths and Locations of Subject Datasets

% Enter the name of the study (for labeling saved decoding results files)
study_name = 'FLANKER';

% Base directory path (where single subject EEG datasets and channel locations files are stored)
bdir = '/home/cogneuro/Downloads/';

% Output directory (where decoding results will be saved)
output_dir = '/home/cogneuro/Downloads/res/';
    
% Filepaths of single subject datasets (relative to the base directory)
sbj_code = {...

    ['EEG Data/sbj1'];... % subject 1
    ['EEG Data/sbj2'];... % subject 2 
    ['EEG Data/sbj3'];... % subject 3
    ['EEG Data/sbj4'];... % subject 4
    ['EEG Data/sbj5'];... % subject 5

    };
    

% Automatically calculates number of subjects from the number of data files
nsbj = size(sbj_code, 1);

% MATLAB workspace name for single subject data arrays and structures
data_struct_name = 'eeg_sorted_cond'; % Data arrays for use with DDTBOX must use this name as their MATLAB workspace variable name
  



%% EEG Dataset Information

nchannels = 61; % Number of channels
sampling_rate = 500; % Data sampling rate in Hz
pointzero = 500; % Corresponds to the time of the event of interest (e.g. stimulus presentation) relative to the start of the epoch (in ms)

% For plotting single subject temporal decoding results 
% (not required if performing spatial or spatiotemporal decoding)
channel_names_file = 'channel_inf_flanker.mat'; % Name of the .mat file containing channel labels and channel locations
channellocs = [bdir, 'Channel Locations/']; % Path of the directory containing channel information file




%% Condition and Discrimination Group (dcg) Information

% Label each condition / category
% Usage: cond_labels{condition number} = 'Name of condition';
% Example: cond_labels{1} = 'Correct Responses';
% Example: cond_labels{2} = 'Error Responses';
% Condition label {X} corresponds to data in column X of the single subject
% data arrays.

cond_labels{1} = 'Correct';
cond_labels{2} = 'Error';
%cond_labels{3} = 'condition_C';
%cond_labels{4} = 'condition_D';
        
% Discrimination groups
% Enter the condition numbers of the conditions used in classification analyses.
% Usage: dcg{discrimination group number} = [condition 1, condition 2];
% Example: dcg{1} = [1, 2]; to use conditions 1 and 2 for dcg 1

% If performing support vector regression, only one condition number is
% needed per dcg.
% SVR example: dcg{1} = [1]; to perform SVR on data from condition 1

dcg{1} = [1, 2];
dcg{2} = [3, 4]; 

% Support Vector Regression (SVR) condition labels
% Enter the array entry containing condition labels for each discrimination
% group number. The SVR_labels array contains multiple cells, each
% containing a list of SVR condition labels.
% Usage: svr_cond_labels{dcg} = [cell number in SVR_labels];
% Example: svr_cond_labels{1} = [2]; to use SVR labels in cell 2 for dcg 1

svr_cond_labels{1} = [1];
              
% Label each discrimination group
% Usage: dcg_labels{Discrimination group number} = 'Name of discrimination group'
% Example: dcg_labels{1} = 'Correct vs. Error Responses';

dcg_labels{1} = 'A vs. C';
dcg_labels{2} = 'B vs. D';

% This section automaticallly fills in various parameters related to dcgs and conditions 
ndcg = size(dcg, 2);
nclasses = size(dcg{1}, 2);      
ncond = size(cond_labels, 2);
